## Sumry :v:

_your project manager, for you._
<br><br>
**Tired of having 2-hour long “standup meetings” which were supposed to be of barely 15 minutes?** We feel your pain too! We developed a wayto save you those unproductive hours. Here we present, **Sumry - a tool that generates a personalized report**, taking into account all the project related activities done throughout the day by each developer. **Our prime motive is to empower Program Managers** with a tool that brings all the work done by their developers on BitBucket, down to a single page.

### Features:

- Encourages transparency among peers.
- Reduces unproductive man-hours.
- Enlists & categorizes each activity done, all at a single place; saving you from a lot of hassle.
- Doesn’t let your ability to justify yourself come in the way of your promotion. We help your work speak for itself.
